# The First Training App

## Preparation

The application we want to write will train a model in the cloud.
We can make it run any training script we want, but for simplicity we are going to provide the code for you.
Copy it into the current section folder:

```commandline
cp -r project 1-First-App/
cd 1-First-App
```

Try to run one of the training scripts to verify all is working locally:

```commandline
python project/train_mnist.py
```

## The Script Runner

Next, Adrian will code with you the app from ground up. Pay close attention :)
If you get lost or want to skip ahead, check the `solution` folder.
